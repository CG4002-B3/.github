## LaserTag++

With a budget of $250, we were tasked to come up with a laser tag game with gesture detection (for reload, grenade, shield and logout actions).
This project aims to produce an immersive game experience that fuses both the modern First Person Shooter (FPS) games and laser tag sport. Through the use of sensory and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies, players can experience a shooting game in a simulated environment. Players will be able to interact with the environment and perform actions such as reloading, throwing grenades and raising shields, which will be visualized on a mobile device that is mounted on the gun. For a more realistic simulation, players will receive vibration feedback from their vest and gun.
